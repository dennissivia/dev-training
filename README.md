Introduction
============

This repository aims to provide a environment for solving programming problems
and implement coding challanges and do code katas. 

It will host all kinds of katas and problems and sulotions in any language I 
am going to work with. 


Why share this project at all ?
===============================

I am going to implement the solutions test-first. Thus anyone wo is interested in
doing similar coding challanges, can simply take the test suite and use them to
verify there solution. In addition to that, someone may find bugs in my solution, 
which I would be glad to know about.
