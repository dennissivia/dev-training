Introduction
============

This repository aims to provide a environment for solving programming problems
and implement coding challanges and do code katas.

It will host all kinds of katas and problems and sulotions in any language I
am going to work with.


Why share this project at all ?
===============================

My main focus is not to share the solutions, but just to have a central repository
for my training stuff that allows easy collaboration and references in cases of
discussions or ideas for refactoring.
In addition to that, someone may find bugs in my solution,
which I would be glad to know about.
