Introduction
============

Ruby solutions to various software engineering problem-sets.

If you are interested in implementing those yourself, just pick
the tests from spec/<challange>/* and implement the solutions.
Maybe my tests can help you spot implementation bugs of maybe 
even performance issues ( If I decide to add peformance tests )
